# libnx - Rust edition

This mostly consists on [libnx](https://github.com/swicthbrew/libnx) raw bindings plus some high level implementations within modules.

As soon as the project gets bigger and more stable, more information and examples will be added here.

## Credits and Thanks

- [ischeinkman](https://github.com/ischeinkman)'s [libnx-rs](https://github.com/ischeinkman/libnx-rs) as the base of this idea, considering that this is a slightly different (and soon extended) version of his bindings.

- SwitchBrew and libnx, of course.
